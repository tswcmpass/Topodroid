<h3>[14] CAVE PROJECTS MANAGER</h3>

This window is accessed from the <i>Projects</i> button of the <i>Main Window</i>.<br><p>

A cave project aggregates surveys that are in the TopoDroid database.
The "cave projects" are stored in Therion-like files in the "tdconfig" folder of TopoDroid.
A project file is saved whenever the project is closed.
Projects can be exported as Therion or Survex files; exports are saved in the "th" and "svx" folders,
respectively.


When you start TopoDroid Manager it displays the list of cave projects in the "tdconfig" folder.
The project list is empty if you have not created any project yet.

<b>Surveys 2D view</b><br>

The survey are displayed in plan view, with midline and station names.
Each survey has a different color. After a while the colors repeat therefore you should display
only two or three surveys at a time.
Equates are shown as dashed red lines, and equated stations have a round background.
The view can be panned and zoomed.
A survey can be grabbed (tap on a station: it gets circled) and dragged around while the other surveys do not move.
In this way you can overlap stations of different surveys that you want to equate.
When they overlap circle them both by tapping the point: you can then insert the equate between them with the menu "add equate".

<h4>BUTTONS</h4>
<ul style="margin-top:0">
<li><i>Add equate</i>: opens a dialog to manually add an equate between surveys of the cave project.</li>
<li><i>List equates</i> between surveys of the cave  project</li>
</ul><br><p>

<h4>MENU</h4>
<ul style="margin-top:0">
<li><i>Close</i> the Cave Project window</li>
<li><i>Help</i></li>
</ul><br><p>

You can drop an equate by tapping its entry in the dialog listing the equates of the cave project.<br><p>
