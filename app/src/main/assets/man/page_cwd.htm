<h4>TopoDroid Project Folders</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
In order to manage cave survey projects involving several survey sessions, it is advisable to use a specific work directory (folder) for each cave project.<br>
The name of any work dircetory must begin with "TopoDroid" (case independent).<br>
The project folders are created inside TopoDroid base folder "Documents/TDX".<br><p>

The drawing symbol files and the files related to the devices (database, firmware, memory dumps, calibrations) are stored only in the
app private "files" folder (in the external storage). The project folders contain only the survey database of the project and survey folders.<br><p>

The choice of the current project folder is one of the general settings of the app in the <u>main window</u>.
