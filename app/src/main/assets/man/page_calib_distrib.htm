<h4>DistoX CALIBRATION DATA DISTRIBUTION</h4>

This dialog is opened from the <i>Distribution</i> button in the <u>calibration data window</u>.<br><p>

It displays the distribution of the calibration data, in azimuth and inclination, i.e, on a 3D sphere.<br><p>

The sphere is cut on the horizontal plane, and the upwards and downwards hemispheres are displayed as two circles.
The center of the circles are the vertical direction, while the points on the border are the horizontal 
directions. On each circle, North is upward, South downward, East to the right and West to the left.<br><p>

Green areas indicate directions covered by the data. Red zones are directions for which data are missing.
The dialog can show either the direction distribution of the raw data, or that of the data corrected with the calibration.<br><p>

<b>Eval</b> computes the distribution using the raw direction values.<br>
<b>Eval. w clib.</b> computes the distribution after correcting the data with the calibration coefficients.<br>
<b>G</b> displays the distribution of the data acceleration vectors in the frame of the DistoX<br>
<b>M</b> displays the distribution of the data magnetic field vectors in the frame of the DistoX<br><p>

A proper calibration data set should have no red spot in all the distributions.<br><p>
