<h4>3d VIEWER - Measure dialog</h4>

When the fixed station is selected, its coordinates appear in a blue bar 
at the bottom of the screen.<br>

This bar has two button:
<ul>
<li>the first sets the station as center of rotations</li>
<li>the second switches the program in "mesure mode": tapping on another
station brins up the <i>Measure</i> dialog with the result of the measurement.</li>
</ul><br><p>

The <i>Measure</i> dialog show the distance between the fixed station and another one.<br>
<ul>
<li>the full names of the two stations</li>
<li>the East, Nort, and vertical displacement between the two stations</li>
<li>the 3D distance</li>
<li>the distance in the horizontal plane</li>
<li>the azimuth and inclination of the straight line between the two stations</li>
<li>if it exists, the length of the shortest path along the cave midline between the two stations,
and the positive and negative denivelations</li>
</ul><br><p> 

<b>Denivelations</b><br>
The positive and negative denivelation are computed summing the vertical components of upwards and downwards legs, respectively.
Only legs with inclination over 10&deg; are considered.
Above 30&deg; the leg vertical component is fully taken into account.
Between 10 and 30&deg; the vertical component is linearly interpolated, ie, multiplied by (clino-10)/20.<br><p>
