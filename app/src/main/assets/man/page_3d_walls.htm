<h4>3D VIEWER - Model walls</h4>

If the model has a sufficient number of splays the walls of the model can be
estimated.
There are three algorithms to compute the walls,
<ul>
<li><i>Hull</i></li>
<li><i>Convex hull</i> builds the walls as a quasi-convex local envelope of the splay endpoints</li>
<li><i>Powercrust</i> works with a huge number of splays, and interpolate the walls through the splay endpoints</li>
</ul><br>

Once computed the display of the walls is toggled on and off with the <i>Walls</i> button of the 
<i>3D viewer</i> window.<br><p>

The dialog has a slider to adjust the walls transparency.<br><p>
