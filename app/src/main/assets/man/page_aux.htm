<h4>TopoDroid ECOSYSTEM</h4>

When working with TopoDroid, you might find useful some complementary and auxiliary apps:
<ul>
<li><i>Proj4</i> is a (very simple) coordinate converter app, used by TopoDroid to convert long-lat values to other coordinate systems</li>
<li><i>MobileTopographer</i> is a geolocation app. You can use it to take the point coordinates and have TopoDroid read them from the point file in MobileTopographer pointlist.</li>
<li><i>CrowdMag</i> is an app by NOAA National Geophysical Data Center, useful to get informations about the current state of the Earth magnetic field.</li>
<li>an app to take pictures (usually there is a <i>Camera</i> app)</li>
<li>a File Manager (eg. <i>MiXplorer</i>) is definitely useful to look at the files (and to make backup copies)</li>
<li><i>SQLiteViewer</i> (or any other SQLite manager app) can be helpful to inspect the TopoDroid databases</li>
</ul><br><p>

In addition, depending how you process your surveys, you may want to install
<ul>
<li>a image viewer/editor (usually there is a preinstalled image viewer, <i>Gallery</i>)</li>
<li>a DXF viewer/editor</li>
<li>a spreadsheet viewer/editor (eg. Google <i>Sheets</i>)</li>
<li>a SVG viewer (eg. <i>SVG viewer</i>)</li>
<li>a ZIP archiver (eg. <i>MiXArchive</i>)</li>
<li><i>GoogleEarth</i></li>
<li><i>AndroWish</i> if you really want to use <i>xtherion</i> on Android (but it will not execute Therion) </li>
<li>a track file viewer (eg, <i>Androzic</i>)</li>
</ul><br><p>

Finally a <i>wakeup-touch</i> app turns out to be very convenient during the survey session in the cave. In order to save battery you may want to set the display sleep timeout very short (eg, half a minute). With a wakeup-touch app you do not have to press the power button to wake up your android, but just need to touch the proximity sensor. I use to keep my device in a protective box opening only the cover lid. The power button on the side is therefore not accessible when the device is in the box, and the wakeup-touch app is really handy.<br><p>

<b>Proj4</b><br>
TopoDroid stores point coordinates in the reference system geographical long-lat WGS-84.
Altitudes are stored both referred to the ellipsoid and to the geoid.<br><p>

The app Proj4 is used by TopoDroid in two ways to transform coordinates between WGS-84 and other coordinate systems.
<ul>
<li>to <a href="page_fixed.htm">convert</a> the coordinates of a point from long-lat (WGS-84) to another coordinate reference system.</li> 
<li>to <a href="page_fixed_add.htm">enter</a> the coordinates of a point in a different coordinate system.</li>
</ul><br><p>
