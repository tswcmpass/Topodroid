<h4>SHOT ACCURACY</h4>

Together with each shot, the DistoX2 records and transmits also the values of the intensity of the magnetic field (arbitrary units), that of the gravitational field (arbitrary units), and the dip angle, that is the angle the magnetic field makes with the horizontal plane.<br><p>

By comparing these values with their average values TopoDroid can detect whether a shot might be affected by some anomaly, and should therefore be redone. These unreliable shots are displayed with a red background.<br><p>

The amount these values can differ from their averages before the shot is declared unreliable are specified by the accuracy settings.<br><p>

<b>Note</b> When surveying in an area with magnetic anomaly, the anomaly analysis based on the magnetic field is not valid.<br><p>
